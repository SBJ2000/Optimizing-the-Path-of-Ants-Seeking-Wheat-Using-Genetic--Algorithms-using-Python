# Optimizing the Path of Ants Seeking Wheat Using Genetic  Algorithms using Python
 This project explores the use of genetic algorithms to optimize the paths of ants in a simulated environment. The objective is to develop an algorithm that evolves ant behavior to efficiently find wheat, overcoming obstacles in the process
